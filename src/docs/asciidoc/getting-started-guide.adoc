= Introduction

REST-ful Spring Statemachine is a RESTful web service for managing orders. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

== Running the service
RESTful Spring Statemachine is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/otrosien/spring-statemachine-jpa-and-rest
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/index/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.
